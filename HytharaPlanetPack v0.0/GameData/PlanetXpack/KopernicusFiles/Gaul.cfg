			description = Gaul, wow, even the name sounds tough! It is considerably farther away from Hythara than Riaz and Lowell, and larger than both of them comined, it's almost a 3rd of Hythara's size. It's the only body in the Hythara System to have a moonlet, nemesis. Gaul is the Tylo of the Hythara system. More surprisingly though, it's chemical composition is far different than Lowell or Riaz, implying it hasn't formed here. Perhaps it was formed somewhere else and captured by Hythara, but that's unlikely. Perhap's Gaul was once one of Jool's moons, and was thrown into Hythara's Gravity well over millenia. That means that once Jool had 6 moons!
